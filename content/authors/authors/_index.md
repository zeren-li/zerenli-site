I am an Assistant Professor at the [Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg). My research focuses on **business-government relations, bureaucracy, good governance, and authoritarian politics**, with a particular interest in China. My work has been published and is forthcoming in the [*British Journal of Political Science*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science), [*Journal of Politics*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3839170), [*Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268123000987?utm_campaign=STMJ_AUTH_SERV_PUBLISHED&utm_medium=email&utm_acid=248459168&SIS_ID=&dgcid=STMJ_AUTH_SERV_PUBLISHED&CMX_ID=&utm_in=DM368176&utm_source=AC_), [*The China Quarterly*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fnk9xi11ssejcwm/Markets_Under_Mao.pdf?dl=0), and other journals.

I am the recipient of the [Kellogg/Notre Dame Award for Best Comparative Politics Paper](https://www.mpsanet.org/professional-resources/awards/award-recipient-archive/) from the 2023 Annual Meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association. I earned my PhD in Political Science from [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). Prior to Duke, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) and completed my MPhil at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/). Before joining NUS, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Leitner Program of Political Economy, MacMillan Center, Yale University](https://leitner.yale.edu/).
